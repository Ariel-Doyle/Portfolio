        My name is Ariel Doyle, I have lived in the PNW for 8 years now. I originally have a background in farming, having come here to learn how to drive horses (like a horse and plough) and tend wine grapes. I have a BA in English Literature and a BS in Psychology. I love reading, gardening, and cooking.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently work as a machine operator at <a href="https://lichenmfg.com/precision/">Lichen Precision</a>, an independently-owned machine shop here in the PNW.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the work I have done with small farms and businesses has helped me to build a community here. Within that community, I have witnessed so many instances where a polished website or more streamlined back-end would increase internet traffic and potentially generate more revenue. I look forward to growing my abilities further, so that I can one day help others to cultivate their dreams, be that non-profits, small businesses, or self-employed freelancers. I'm excited to provide an affordable avenue to a polished and professional website!
